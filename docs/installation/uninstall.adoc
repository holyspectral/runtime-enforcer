= Runtime-Enforcer Uninstall

You can remove the Runtime-Enforcer and all the policies created by uninstalling the `helm` chart as follows:

```bash
helm uninstall runtime-enforcer --namespace runtime-enforcer
```

Please note that this command will delete all existing WorkloadPolicy and WorkloadPolicyProposal in an irreversible way.

Finally, delete the namespace where Runtime-Enforcer was deployed:

```bash
kubectl delete ns runtime-enforcer
```

You can also delete the otel-collector and the cert-manager:

```bash
helm uninstall otel-collector --namespace otel-collector
kubectl delete ns otel-collector

helm uninstall cert-manager --namespace cert-manager
kubectl delete ns cert-manager
```
