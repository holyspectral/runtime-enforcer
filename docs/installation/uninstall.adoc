= Runtime-Enforcer Uninstall

You can remove the Runtime-Enforcer and all the policies created by uninstalling the `helm` chart as follows:

```bash
helm uninstall runtime-enforcer --namespace runtime-enforcer
```

Please note that this command will not delete the existing WorkloadPolicy and WorkloadPolicyProposal.

To remove them, you can run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get workloadpolicies.security.rancher.io --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace --no-headers | while read name namespace; do
  kubectl patch workloadpolicies.security.rancher.io $name -n $namespace --type=merge -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}'
done

kubectl delete crd workloadpolicies.security.rancher.io
kubectl delete crd workloadpolicyproposals.security.rancher.io
```

Finally, delete the namespace where Runtime-Enforcer was deployed:

```bash
kubectl delete ns runtime-enforcer
```

You can also delete the otel-collector and the cert-manager:

```bash
helm uninstall otel-collector --namespace otel-collector
kubectl delete ns otel-collector

helm uninstall cert-manager --namespace cert-manager
kubectl delete ns cert-manager
```
